![](https://github.com/gregoryoffodum/Company-Tracker-App/blob/master/tracker%20app.gif)

## Introduction

The application tracks employee information including name, departments, salary, permissions, positions, tasks etc. with appropriate admin controls. 
Using C sharp Windows .NET framework, forms have been created for each page of the app (Employee, Salary, Tasks, Permissions, Department, Position). Add, select, update and
delete operations of fields have also been programmed accordingly. Administrative controls are such that non-admin users cannot access public information, only personal data.

A 3-tier framework was adopted - the application UI layer, [Business Logic Layer (BLL)](https://github.com/gregoryoffodum/Company-Tracker-App/tree/master/BLL), 
and [Data Access Layer (DAL)](https://github.com/gregoryoffodum/Company-Tracker-App/tree/master/DAL) containing data transfer and access objects, all connected to a database
with LINQ
